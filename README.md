## Algorithms

- **Heapify**: Ensures the subtree is a max-heap.
- **Build Max-Heap**: Converts an array into a max-heap.
- **Heapsort**: Sorts the array using the max-heap.

## Analysis

- **Heapify**:
    - Time Complexity: O(log n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Description: Keeps the max-heap property in a subtree.

- **Build Max-Heap**:
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Description: Converts an array into a max-heap by heapifying non-leaf nodes.

- **Heapsort**:
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Description: Sorts the array by building a max-heap and repeatedly extracting the max element.
